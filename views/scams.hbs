            <h4 class="m-4 w-75 lh-base border-top border-bottom border-2 p-3 fst-italic">When I started looking for houses in Canada from my home country, I used online platforms to find houses and I found one house. It looked real and the landlord spoke properly and even told he will help me in arranging pick ups from the airport. But he wanted a deposit to confirm the house booking. But after I transferred the money, he blocked my number, and I was not able to get in touch with him. <br> <div class="m-auto text-end pt-2"><small class="text-muted ">- An International Student in Barrie, Ontario</small></div></h4>

            <h4 class="m-4 w-75 lh-base border-top border-bottom border-2 p-3 fst-italic">This happened a year ago when I was trying to move to Barrie. I spoke with the landlord through an online platform and even visited the place to confirm the house. As I liked the house the landlord asked me to sign a rental agreement. It asked for my SIN number. As I was new to Canada, I did not know that SIN number should not be shared. But luckily, I sent the agreement to one my friends who was already living here to just check it out. Then I got to know that you should not share the SIN number. I was lucky but itâ€™s not the case with everyone else. <br> <div class="m-auto text-end pt-2"><small class="text-muted">- An International Student in Barrie, Ontario</small></div></h4>

        <h4 class="mt-5 lh-base bg-success text-light border border-3 border-dark p-4">My advice for the students would be to check out the house physically before signing any agreement. If possible, send the agreement to someone who has been in Canada for some years and tell them to have a look at it before signing.</h4>

        <h4 class="mt-5 lh-base bg-success text-light border border-3 border-dark p-4">Do not share any personal information with anyone. Like SIN number, bank details etc. </h4>

        <h4 class="mt-5 lh-base bg-success text-light border border-3 border-dark p-4">If the housing photos look blurry then it probably means it is fake. This is a tip to investigate while looking for houses on an online platform. </h4>

        <h4 class="mt-5 lh-base bg-success text-light border border-3 border-dark p-4">Do not deal with cash. Make sure that you either do a wire transfer or get a written agreement stating that you have paid the landlord. </h4>
